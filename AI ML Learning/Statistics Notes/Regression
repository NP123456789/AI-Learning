Regression in it's basic form is trying to predict the out put variable, called the dependent variable, based on the values that are the inputs. 

Input variables = x = Independent variable

Output variable = y = Dependent variable

Coefficent =  The relationship between the values wihin a given dataset. This can give us a straight line that will explain if their is a posative or negative trend with the data.

Simple Regression
y = b0 + b1*x1

b0 =  is the y-intercept of the regression line. Also he constant

b1 = refered to as the coefficent 


Ordinary Least Squares
This is calculated for each value within the dataset. It find the min value and this is the OLS

OLS = SUM(y - y^)^2 -> min

y = is the actual value observed 

y^ = is the value expected
