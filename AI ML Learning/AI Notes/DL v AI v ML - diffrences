Artificial Intelligence:

Empowers computers to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, text processing and visual interpritation.
AI is a broad field, this contains many sub fields such as machine learning, robotics and computer vision. 

Machine Learning:

Machine learning is a sub field of AI that allows for computers to improve at a task over a given period of time.
Rule based systems can be classified as AI but this is not ML as it does not learn from experience. 

Example:
Machine learning Process: (1) selecting the model to train, (2) manually performing feature extraction

Deep learning:

This is a specialized field of Machine Learning that relies on training of Deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
AMMs are infomation processing models, inspired by the human brain, that use large data sets.
AAMs work by mathematically mimicking the human brain and connecting multiple “artificial” neurons in a multilayered fashion.
The more hidden layers added to the network, the deeper the network gets.

What differentiates deep learning from machine learning techniques is in their ability to extract features automatically as 
illustrated in the following example:

Deep Learning Process: (1) Select the architecture of the network, (2) features are automatically extracted by feeding in the training data 
(such as images) along with the target class (label).
